The app uses HTTP protocol and REST API to create a virtual CLI library. The following were used when implementing the code:

Server interactions:
	1) Creating an account with a POST access route
	2) Authentification, which returns session cookie after a POST request and logging out using GET
	3) Library access. If the user is logged in, it returns a JWT token.
	4) Books information, given by GET requests
	5) Deleting books using DELETE
Server testing using Postman
JSON parsing 
CLI Client with commands such as register, login, enter_library, get_books, add_book, delete_book, logout and exit.
